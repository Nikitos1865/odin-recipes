    <h1>Batido de Mamey Recipe</h1>

    <h2>It's pronounced maMEY...</h2>
    <p>Mamey might sound like a strange name for a fruit for people who don't 
        have much experience with Caribbean cooking and horticulture, but it is 
        actually a staple fruit with an important place in Cuban and Mexican cultures.
        This is a recipe for a refreshing summer smoothie (batido) made with this 
        wonderfully pink-orange, flavorful fruit. Note: it might be hard to get your 
        hands on a fresh mamey in the United States, where I live, but worry not! This 
        recipe works very well with frozen mamey you might be able to find in your latin/Caribbean 
        grocery store's frozen food isle. This cold, fruity treat can often be found in 
        Cuban bakeries and cafe's around south Florida and North Jersey, to get an idea of
        how it should taste.

    <h3><u>Ingredients:</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of whole milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of condensed milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of sugar</li>
        <li>2 cups of mamey pulp (frozen is fine!)</li>
        <li>2 cups of ice</li>
        <li>A pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation/Steps</h3>
    <p>The preparation for this smoothie is simple as can be! Great for
        larger parties, since you can make a fairly large amount at a time.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>All you really need to do is put all the ingredients in 
            blender, and blend for about 30-60 seconds until you reach
            your desired consistency. You should get a very creamy smoothy. 
            If you find that it is too thick, you can add water to thin it out 
            little by little.  
        </li>
        <li> Add the ice after the other ingredients and blend for a few
            more minutes until completely smooth. 
        </li>
        <li> Serve immediately!</li>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> This smoothie is better consumed immediately. After a few hours
            it can change its taste and even turn slightly bitter.</p>
    </ol>
