    <h2>The History of Quimbomb贸 Guisado</h2>
    <p>The history of the use of quimbomb贸 in Cuban cuisine dates back to when
        African slaves were first taken to the then Spanish governate. Quimbomb贸
        or, as more commonly known in English, okra is everpresent in the cooking
        of African diaspora across the world, from Africa itself to the southern 
        United States. This is an example of a Cuban stewed okra recipe, which features
        influences from both African and European cuisines.

        <h3 class="list"><u>Preparation/Steps</u></h3>
        <ol class="list">
            <li>Begin by peeling the green plantains</li>
            <li> Following this, boil the plantains until they get slightly soft
            let them chill, and then squash them into a dough-like consistency. 
            </li>
            <li>When the dough is achieved, roll pieces of it into balls (meatball sized)
            and leave them in the fridge (if the plantains you use are ripe,
            do not follow this step.)
            </li>
            <li>Wash your kilogram of okra.</li>
            <li>Cut away the two ends (optional) and cut into "wheels" of about 3/4 inch wide.</li>
            <li>Place them in a bowl with the lemon juice and 1/2 liter of water.</li>
            <li>In a deep pot, place the lard inside the bowl and heat, and once cut up in cubes,
            fry your pork pieces. 
            </li>
            <li>When the pork becomes golden, add the onion, the garlic, and the bell peppers</li>
            <li>Once the onion and peppers start to sweat i.e. when the onions are translucent 
            and the garlic becomes soft, add the tomato paste and the wine.
            </li>
            <li>(Optional) At this stage you might want to add any dry spices, such as
            paprika or oregano.
            </li>
            <li>It is now time to add the okra and half of the water with lemon juice.</li>
            <li>Wait until boiling and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>When the okra becomes soft, add in the plantain balls, and wait until
                it boils once again.
            </li>
        </ol>
