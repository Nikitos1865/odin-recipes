    <h2>Deep fried chickpeas? Sign me up!</h2>
    <p>Falafel is a popular fried street food in parts of the Middle East,
        and especially the mediterranean. There are a number of different 
        variations to falafel, but this is my roommate's, whose family is 
        from Israel. Falafel is commonly eaten with pita, fresh vegetables 
        such as tomato, cucumber, onion, and parsley and a white sauce
        called tahini.
